== Introduction

Duke Level 10 (Duke) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling tasks*. More importantly, Duke is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Duke can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `8` (revision `1.8.0_201` or later) installed in your Computer.

[NOTE]

This app will not work with later major Java releases such as Java 9, 10, 11, etc.
+
.  Download the latest `duke.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
